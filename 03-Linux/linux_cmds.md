    * `[]`: Defines a set of characters, matching any one character within the set.
        * `-` : Specifies a range of characters when used inside square brackets.
        * `^` : match with what is not in range
    * `*` : Matches 0 or more occurrences of the preceding character or group.
    * `()`: Groups expressions and captures the matched text (Extended).
    * `{}`: Specifies the exact number of occurrences of the previous element (Extended)
        * `{n}`   : n times
        * `{n,m}` : n to m times
        * `{n,}`  : n or more times
        * `{,m}`  : m or less times
         
    * `?` : Matches 0 or 1 occurrence of the preceding character or group (Extended)
    * `+` : Matches 1 or more occurrences of the preceding character or group (Extended)
    * `|` : Acts as a logical OR, matching either the expression before or after it (Extended)
    * `\` : Escapes a special character or introduces a special sequence
* shorthand classes
    * `\w` : equivalent to `[a-zA-Z0-9_]`
    * `\s` : stands for space characters or tabs or line breaks
    * `\t` : stands for tabs
    * `\r` : carriage return
    * `\n` : line feed

## File Compression and Archiving

* TAR (Tape Archive): Combines multiple files into a single archive without compressing them. 
    * It's used for bundling files together, typically in Linux/Unix systems.

* GZIP: A compression tool that reduces the size of individual files or archives. 
    * It is often used with TAR to compress the TAR archive (.tar.gz).

* Use TAR when: You want to bundle multiple files together into one archive without compressing.
* Use GZIP when: You want to compress files for storage or transfer. Often, youâ€™ll combine them (tar + gzip) to archive and compress simultaneously.

```
tar cf {target.tar} {{file1} {file2}
tar tvf {{path/to/source.tar}}          # List the contents of a tar
tar xvf {{path/to/source.tar}}          # extract an archive

tar czf {target.tar.gz} {file1} {file2} # compress in addition

gunzip --list {{file.txt.gz}}   # list
gunzip {{archive.tar.gz}}       # decompresses only resulting in a tar file
tar xvzf {{archive.tar.gz}}     # both decompresses and extracts the files

```
